1. show "מיישר תזמונים" until we get a response from the endpoint (done)
2. make sure after we get the alignment and update the db successfuly, we pull the changes from the db and show the updated state of the document (done)
3. when the "השוואות" tab in the diff card is open and the user did some edit and saved it, and then the user navigates between files in the browser - the השוואות tab should update to show the current shown transcript (not to be stuck behind) (done)
4. it seems like after a successful alignment, the corrections are dropped/reverted to initial state in the transcript card (but not in the diff card where you can see the actual fixes, which means the data )
5. log any Clamp end_time >= start_time.
If rw.end or rw.start missing log it
In /transcripts/words, before emitting JSON:
If end_time is NULL or <= start_time log it
the goal is to have automated tests - no manual clicks, full coverage
